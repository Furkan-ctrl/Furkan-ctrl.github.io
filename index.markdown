## Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! I am **Furkan**, a student in SITE 1101.

<img src="/assets/profile.jpg" alt="Furkan's Profile Photo" width="200" style="border-radius: 50%;">

I am developing this website to showcase my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Jekyll**. This project has helped me learn how to use Git version control and deploy websites to the cloud.

Please feel free to check out my [About Page](/about/) or see my [Projects](/projects/).
